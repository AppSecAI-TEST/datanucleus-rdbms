<BODY>
    This package provides classes defining the (SCO) backing store for various container classes (Collections/Maps/arrays) within DataNucleus.
    These classes handle the reading/writing of data from/to the datastore for these SCO containers.
    There should be a maximum of one backing store per class member, shared amongst all objects with that member.
    Each backing store should be thread-safe.
